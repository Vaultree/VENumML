# VENumML Demos

Welcome to the `demos` folder of the VENumML repository! This directory contains a variety of examples and demonstrations to help users understand and utilise the `VENumML` library for encrypted machine learning. Each demo showcases specific features or use cases of the `VENumML` library, allowing users to experiment with different aspects of the technology in practical scenarios.

## Folder Structure

The `demos` folder is organised as follows:

- **examples**: This folder contains several simple examples of venumML, typically comparing them against plaintext approaches.
    - **Linear Regression**: Demonstrates training and inference using an encrypted linear regression model.
    - **Logistic Regression**: Demonstrates inference using an encrypted logistic regression model.
    - **FFT demo**: A fully working encrypted Fourier transform!
- **use cases**: This folder contains several simple examples of venumML, typically comparing them against plaintext approaches.   d
    - **Phineus**: Model trends, seasonality and prediction in encryted time series data using fourier transforms and linear regression.
    - **Transformer**: Showcases the steps involved in training and using an encrypted instance of transformers.
    - **Facial Recognition**: Provides an introduction to performing facial recognition over encrypted images.
    - **Graph**: Using encrypted graphs and PageRank to show how employee reviews can be mined for key insights, all while keeping sensitive information private.
    - **Social Media**: Influental users of a popular private forum can be served relevant advertisements based on the classification of their encrypted posts.

## Note

These demos are basic examples of `VENumML` and might require additional libraries for data manipulation and visualization depending on your specific needs.
