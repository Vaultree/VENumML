    "### scenario\n",
    "In this scenario, we are going to simulate the collboration between a social media platform (made up of subforums discussing various topics) and a company wishing to advertise. \n",
    "### Privacy Concerns \n",
    "In certain instances, these subforums are of a sensitive nature, and posts are kept private to approved members only. Specifically the subforum we are targeting is \"Health and Wellness\" and the product being advertised is a sleep tracking app. \n",
    "### Business Case\n",
    "The social media company, which we will call ClickReadShare and the advertiser, Snoo-Ze-Time, want to share data in a secure manner that respects the users privacy and ensures that Snoo-Ze-Time can identify users that are:\n",
    "* A relevant fit for the product (e.g. they have discussed sleep issues/advice in the health and wellness subforum)\n",
    "* An influential member of the community (so that if they do buy the product, and enjoy it, they are an ideal source for word of mouth)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "Here ClickReadShare has agreed to share an encrypted summary of the users' posts in the subforum, as well as an encrypted graph showing who follows who. It's up to Snoo-Ze-Time to decide how to rank and classify the users. Snoo-Ze-Time has trained a transformer to classify the user summaries, and has decided to use PageRank to rank the users. Once they have classified the users according to their interest in sleep health, and ranked them according to their network influence, Snoo-Ze-Time sends back to ClickReadShare the encrypted results. ClickReadShare can then decrypt and identify which users would be a good fit for the add, without disclosing any information to the advertiser."
